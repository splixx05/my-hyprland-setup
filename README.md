## Hyprland setup made by r!cky

This setup was inspired by Stephan Raabe and his great contribution (https://github.com/mylinuxforwork).
It includes some of his configs and behavior of modules and windows.

As a newcomer and hobbyist, it is a great pleasure for me to have created my own Hyprland setup and I will certainly continue to tinker with it.
All settings have been tested and implemented on EndeavourOS, but not all parameters work as expected yet.
If you still find things or settings missing, please contact me. I am happy to learn.
